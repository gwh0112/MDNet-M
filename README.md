Multiple targets tracking with MDNet

Please download the original MDNet tracker (Matlab) from https://github.com/HyeonseobNam/MDNet. Then replace the original /tracking folder with this folder. 

Note:
1. In the main file demo_tracking, you can define the input sequence and multiple targets ground truth in the first frame.
2. I'm still working on the candidate pool to speed up the process. For now, please use fewer targets (say 2~3) to test your idea.
